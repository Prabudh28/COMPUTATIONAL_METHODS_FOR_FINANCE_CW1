Python Finance Analysis Project

This repository contains code for analyzing and visualizing financial data using Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and yfinance. This project is part of the Computational Methods for Finance module and focuses on fundamental data handling techniques, visualization, and financial model applications like the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Project Overview
This project is divided into three sections:

1. Python Fundamentals

Explains key Python libraries and concepts essential for data science and finance:
NumPy: Efficient array operations, matrix manipulations, and fundamental numerical computations.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis, especially for handling tabular data like financial time series.
Matplotlib: Data visualization, including line plots and histograms, which are crucial for data analysis.
YFinance: Retrieval of financial data, such as stock prices, directly from Yahoo Finance.

2. Data Handling

a.Selects two FTSE 100 equities (e.g., Unilever and HSBC).

b.Downloads two years of daily historical data for each equity using yfinance.

c.Visualizes stock price movements over time.

d.Calculates annualized returns and volatility, providing insight into each equityâ€™s risk-return profile.

3.Financial Analysis

Provides an overview of the Black-Scholes model for option pricing.
Explains the model derivation, assumptions, and final formula.
Discusses the implications of each assumption and the importance of volatility in option pricing.
