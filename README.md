**Python Finance Analysis Project**

This repository contains code for analyzing and visualizing financial data using Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and yfinance. This project is part of the Computational Methods for Finance module and focuses on fundamental data handling techniques, visualization, and financial model applications like the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Project Overview:

This project is divided into three sections:

**Python Fundamentals**:

Explains key Python libraries and concepts essential for data science and finance:
NumPy: Efficient array operations, matrix manipulations, and fundamental numerical computations.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis, especially for handling tabular data like financial time series.
Matplotlib: Data visualization, including line plots and histograms, which are crucial for data analysis.
YFinance: Retrieval of financial data, such as stock prices, directly from Yahoo Finance.

**Data Handling**:

a.Selects two FTSE 100 equities (e.g., Unilever and HSBC).

b.Downloads two years of daily historical data for each equity using yfinance.

c.Visualizes stock price movements over time.

d.Calculates annualized returns and volatility, providing insight into each equity’s risk-return profile.

**Financial Analysis**:

Provides an overview of the Black-Scholes model for option pricing.
Explains the model derivation, assumptions, and final formula.
Discusses the implications of each assumption and the importance of volatility in option pricing.



**Requirements**:

To run the code provided in the Jupyter Notebook, you’ll need to have the following libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib yfinance


**Usage:**

Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open the .ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

jupyter notebook CourseWork1_CMF.ipynb


Structure

i)   CourseWork1_CMF.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing code and explanations for each task.

ii)  README.md: Project overview and instructions.

iii) requirements.txt: List of required libraries and dependencies (optional, if you choose to create one).
